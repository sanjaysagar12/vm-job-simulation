### Static Customer Submission Form (HTML & CSS - Simple Frontend Structure)
- Objective: Build the basic visual structure and apply initial styling for the customer-facing support form within a simple, root-level frontend/ directory.


- Create a folder named \`frontend\` in your project root.
- Inside \`frontend\`, add two files: \`index.html\` and \`style.css\`.
- In \`index.html\`, build a simple HTML5 page with:
  - Title: VelsyMedia Support Request
  - Link to your CSS file
  - A heading: Submit Your Support Request
  - A form with:
    - Subject (text input, required)
    - Description (textarea, required)
    - Submit button
- In \`style.css\`, add basic styles for the body, form, inputs, textarea, and button.
- Open \`index.html\` in your browser to check your work.
